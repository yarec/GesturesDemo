######Using Gesture Recognizers to Handle Pinch, Rotate, Pan, Swipe and Tap Gestures<br>
A gesture recognizer is actually an object of the abstract class UIGestureRecognizer. Such an object is related to a view, and monitors for predefined gestures made on that view. Going one level deeper, I would say that gestures are actually touches and movements of one or more fingers that happen on a specific area of the screen, where a view of interest exists there. In the early versions of iOS SDK, gestures recognizers were not provided to developers, so implementing such ways of interaction required a lot of manual work. Thankfully, Apple wrapped up all that manual work and gave it to developers as a single tool, and that way working with gestures became a really easy part of the iOS programming.
